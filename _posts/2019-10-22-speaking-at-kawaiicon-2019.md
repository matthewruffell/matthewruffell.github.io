title: Speaking at Kawaiicon 2019
categories: Talks
---

A few months ago when I was applying to the CFP for Chcon, I thought, why not
also submit to Kiwicon / Kawaiicon as well?

My first Kiwicon was in 2012, and I have been going every year since, and I have
always thoroughly enjoyed myself and learnt a lot. I guess it was a bit of a dream
that one day I might be able to present a talk at this super cool conference.

Well, I was pretty ecstatic when I got accepted to speak at Kawaiicon!

Kawaiicon is Kiwicon, but cuter. It actually started off as a joke when the
Kiwicon organisers forgot to renew the kiwicon.org domain name, and brought
kawaiicon.org as a contingency, but I guess this year they followed through and
had a cute themed con!

On Friday morning I gave my talk [The Story of the "Uncrackable" Lockbox, and Why 
Hackers Need to Work Alongside Developers](https://kawaiicon.org/talks/uncrackable-lockbox/).

The talk has been uploaded to Youtube, which you can find below:

The talk is a heavy rewrite and modified version of the same talk I gave a week
previous at Chcon. I tidied up the slides, formatted things to make it easier to
follow along with, and compressed the content from 45 minutes to a 15 minute
lightning talk.

I actually think the Kawaiicon talk went better than the Chcon talk, and I am
very pleased with how it went. I got plenty of positive feedback from attendees
that they liked my talk, and it made reverse engineering look interesting, which
is awesome to know.

At every loot slide, I had arranged with the organisers to get pyro, and they had
these amazing spark fountains:

[Jason Danner](https://twitter.com/jpdanner) captured a very cool tweet storm
of my talk, and I will reproduce it below. Mostly for archival and easy locating
in the future. Anyway, Jason, you are an absolute legend. I'll buy you a drink
next time I see you.

The whole con was a blast, and I met and chatted to a lot of amazing people.
I can't wait for next year!
