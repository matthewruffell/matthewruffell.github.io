I was lucky enough to be selected to speak at linux.conf.au 2019, which was held in Christchurch, at the University of Canterbury.

My talk, [Maintaining the Unmaintainable: Picking up the Baton of a Secure Kernel Patchset](https://lca2019.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/180/) is about my experience in attempting to forward port the last release of the grsecurity patchset to newer kernels, and my time maintaining a public release that targets Linux 4.9 LTS.

I put a lot of time into practising the talk at least once a day for about two weeks straight, and I am happy with how it turned out.

The talk has been uploaded to YouTube, so check it out below, and also have a look at the other talks - there was a lot of interesting talks by the open source community this year.

Very cool! 

I have also met and talked to a huge range of people when I was attending this conference. Linux.conf.au is a fantastic time to be able talk to people who you only ever see on mailing lists, and share common interests with you. 

I found the whole experience so good, I will make sure to attend LCA 2020! 

This means that I will go to at least three conferences a year now, with Kiwicon, Chcon and LCA catching my interest. 

Now I just need to think of something to speak about for LCA 2020. Watch this space.
